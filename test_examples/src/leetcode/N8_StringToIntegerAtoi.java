8. String to Integer (atoi)
* Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither
* present.
Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the
* string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to
* remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater
* than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

Example 1:
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42

Explanation:
The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
Example 2:

Input: s = " -042"

Output: -42
